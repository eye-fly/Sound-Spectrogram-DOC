bugs:
     it restarts afther a substaintial working time - meybe fixed



0. use fft/cache.h ehen esp32-s3 is avaiable
<!-- 0. allow saving changes permanently -->
<!-- there is problem with saving colors as all have same name in 'preferences' -->
1. set menu to be undestractable



1.5. fix binary-code modulation (rgb(193,0,0) is brighter than rgb(194,0,0)) also 145 brighter that 146
<!-- 2. display color in color change menu -->

<!-- 2.5 add menu_item limits -->

2.8. dynamic brightness/lightness(to white)
2.9.meybe add feading out phase to make movment look smother / pixels aren't turn off instantly but diomed to 5-20%

3. more custom backgrounds - menu for choosing and adjusting

3.5. colur pair presets

4. change to 60-50hz <<==looks like dog shit/ why???
    pritn hub75 display refresh rate


4.0. add blink/indicator when long press
    or register longpress as soon as posible (don't whaut for relese)
    meybe add adaptive encoder speed


4.1 choose better microcontroller (pobably ESP32-S3)
    use of vectorized instructions



5. check if wif avaiable/how much cost
    upload img/background

6. what to do with loging\debug and how to encode uploded code

100. QRcode settings if wifi works

Example psram usage
uint8_t (*myArray)[60] = (uint8_t (*)[60])ps_malloc(60 * 60 * sizeof(uint8_t));


add "interpolation" with probability density function of normal dist
use precomputed value
check if just scaling (x and y) one tamplate is enought
what to do about drums?
// main baneffit should be that filltering/ smoting can be applide or peak can
 be made wider to make them more visible / independent of fft nonzero sample size


use to optimize flame
