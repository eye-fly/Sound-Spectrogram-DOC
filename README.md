## ðŸš€ About

This project is a **Sound Spectrogram** designed for visualizing music, with a primary focus on achieving a high refresh rate (approximately 100 Hz) and high resolution for a relatively small frequency range (0 Hz - 700 Hz). This allows rapid changes in sound to be effectively captured and displayed, even on inexpensive hardware.

The main hardware component utilized is the **ESP32 microcontroller**, chosen for its affordability. However, due to the poor resolution of the ESP32's internal ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), an external ADC was integrated to ensure higher fidelity in audio capture.  
*See diagram below for reference: ![Diagram](doc/diagram.png)*

Additionally, a rotary encoder is included for user interface interactions.

For the **HUB75 protocol** used to communicate with the LED display, the [ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA library](https://github.com/mrcodetastic/ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA) was employed.

### Key Features:

- **DMA (Direct Memory Access):**  
  - Drives the display without CPU usage. The CPU only changes pixel values in RAM when necessary, while DMA handles the rest.  
  - DMA is also used to receive data from the external ADC and store it in RAM, ready for processing in the next frame.

- **Dual-Core Usage:**  
  - Tasks are divided between two concurrent processes, enabling faster refresh rates.  
  - Ensures that during long display updates or user interface handling, audio sampling remains uninterrupted, avoiding data loss.

- **Optimized Pixel Update:**  
  - Only pixels that change compared to previous frames are updated, reducing processing load.

- **Downsampling Audio Data:**  
  - Allows for smaller FFT sample sizes, optimizing performance even with the minimum sample frequency of the external ADC.  
  - A low-pass filter is used before downsampling to improve accuracy.

- **Rolling Window with Zero Padding:**  
  - Enables a high refresh rate while providing the FFT with sufficient samples for stable results.  
  - Adjustable zero padding increases resolution and offers user control to emphasize quick sounds like drum beats.  
  - Preprocessing with the Hann function optimizes performance, avoiding real-time computation slowdowns.

- **Live Adjustments via Built-in Menu:**  
  - Users can adjust parameters and immediately observe their effects.
